Solving https://adventofcode.com/2025/day/12

We're in a cavern full of Christmas trees.
We need to organise the presents under the trees.
Presents must be arranged to form a 2D grid of non-overlapping presents. 
- They will not be stacked.
- Presents can be rotated and flipped.

The input has two sections:
1. The shapes of each present, each as a multiline string. E.g. 

```
0:
###
##.
##.
```

2. Region sizes, with a list of the quantities of each present that need to fit in this region

```
12x5: 1 0 1 0 2 2
```

This menas 1 of shape 0, 0 of shape 1, 1 of shape 2, etc.

Part 1:

How many of the regions can fit all of the presents listed?

Solution thoughts:

- Pre-compute all the rotations and flips for each present, and exclude
  configurations that are duplicates. In the sample data, shape 0 has 8 configs
  whilst, shape 5 has only 2 configs.
- We can use NumPy to store the shapes and apply the rotations and flips easily.
- There are only 6 presents, so the total number of configs will be small.
- Parse the regions. Let's create a class for the Region.
- For each tree space, we don't need to find all valid configurations. 
  We just need *a* configuration. So we can do recursive DFS.
- Call can_fit(region) 
  - Start by adding up the sizes of all the presents to be placed, 
    and check if they fit in the region. If not, we're done already.
  - Make an assumption about how much extra space we need to support the required shapes.
    I'm gonna go with 20% extra space.
    If we don't have this extra space, the shapes won't fit.
  - If we're here, they might fit.

*** Oh, seems this was good enough.

- Now check if they will fit...
  - Initialises empty grid of the correct size.
  - Calls recursive fit(grid, remaining_presents)
    - If no remaining presents, return True
    - Otherwise, find all valid placements for each config of this present.
    - For each valid placement: place, recurse, return True. Remove, go to next placement.
    - If not valid placements: return False.
