Solving https://adventofcode.com/2025/day/11

We need to connect a new server rack to the reactor!
The input is a list of devices and their outputs. E.g.

```
aaa: you hhh
you: bbb ccc
bbb: ddd eee
ccc: ddd eee fff
```

Part 1:

How many different paths lead from you to out?

Let's build a graph with NetworkX and use its built-in function to find all paths.

Part 2:

Find all of the paths that lead from svr to out.
How many of those paths visit both dac and fft?

Solution Approach:

My first thought was simply to do the same as Part1, but with a different source and target.
(I guessed there would be a gotcha with this approach!)
It turns out that there's just far too many paths and this doesn't complete.
So we need a smarter way to find the valid paths.

There are two valid sequences to visit both devices `dac` and `fft`:

1. svr -> dac -> fft -> out
2. svr -> fft -> dac -> out

For sequence 1, we can:

1. Count paths from svr -> dac
2. Count paths from dac -> fft
3. Count paths from fft -> out

Multiply the counts together to get the total number of paths.
Then repeat for sequence 2.

Because there are so many paths to check, we need to optimise.
I've used a memoized recursive function to count paths between nodes.
